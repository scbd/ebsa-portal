The Mid-Atlantic Ridge separates the Newfoundland and Labrador Basins from the West-European Basin and the Irminger Sea from the Iceland Basin, influencing hydrography and circulation. The ridge crest is generally cut by a deep rift valley along its length, bordered by high rift mountains, which are bordered by high fractured plateaus. This region is largely composed of volcanic rock, which is the foundation of the area and provides a hard-bottom substrate for the colonization of benthic communities, including vulnerable and habitat-forming species. The area supports several endangered and threatened shark and ray species. The Ridge itself and its complex hydrographic setting contribute to enhanced vertical mixing and turbulence, resulting in areas of increased productivity above  the Ridge. The 2,500 m depth contour is used to inform the boundary of the area, capturing most of the ridge crest and known distribution of deep-water corals.",

The Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone is an unusual left lateral strike-slip double transform fault in the North Atlantic Ocean, along which the rift valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is offset by 350 km near 52º30′N. It opens the deepest connection between the northwest and northeast Atlantic (maximum depth of approximately 4500 m) and is approximately 2000 km in length, extending from about 25°W to 45°W. It is the most prominent interruption of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the Azores and Iceland and the only fracture zone between Europe and North America that has an offset of this size. Two named seamounts are associated with the transform faults: Minia and Hecate. The area is a unique geomorphological feature in the North Atlantic. Further, it captures the Earth’s geological history, including significant ongoing geological processes. The sub-polar front is also representative of a pelagic frontal system. The area is described based on its importance as a section of the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is a biogeographically representative section of the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge. There is evidence of both deep-sea sponge aggregations and cold-water corals in this area. In addition, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the only extensive hard substrate available for propagation of benthic suspension feeders off the continental shelves and isolated seamounts in the region.",

These fronts and eddies enhance primary productivity and retain and concentrate secondary productivity both vertically and horizontally. The combination of localised high-intensity mixing in the eddies results in patchy, high surface, productivity at fine scales. Tracking data collected for seabirds, whales, sea-turtles, tunas and sharks (several of which are globally threatened) confirm that this is an area of high productivity, with a high intensity of foraging activity, suggesting that productivity cascades to higher trophic levels.",

Studies have shown that as the ocean takes up atmospheric CO2, thereby mitigating the rate of climate change, there is a concomitant increase in ocean acidification. This in turn means a reduction in carbonate ion concentration and hence a reduced ability of reef-building organisms to calcify.  Tropical reef-building corals secrete calcium carbonate as aragonite and tend to show a reduction in calcification rate at lower seawater aragonite saturation states (Langdon and Atkinson 2005). Aragonite is the principal crystalline form of calcium carbonate deposited in coral skeletons (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007).  Values of aragonite saturation states above 4 are considered optimal, between 3.5 and 4 are considered marginal, 3-3.5 very marginal, and no corals historically are found below values of 3 (Guinotte et al. 2003). In the Pacific the value of aragonite saturation state in surface waters on average has dropped from around 4.5  to a current value of 3.7 over the last 200 years.\nCurrent measurements show an area to the east of American Samoa has the highest aragonite concentrations at present. As ocean acidification is driven primarily by the uptake of atmospheric CO2 the rates of decrease in aragonite saturation state are similar for the entire region. Consequently those areas with currently higher aragonite saturation states are the least affected for the longest period under climate change projections. Therefore, this area has special biological and ecological value as an area where the impact from ocean acidification will be slowest and from which recovery may potentially be the quickest.",

It comprises the Abrolhos and Royal Charlotte banks, an area of 56.000 km2. It harbours the highest marine biodiversity in the South Atlantic, the largest coral reefs in Brazil, and relatively large populations of several endemic and endangered marine species. It presents a mosaic of different habitats, like mangroves, seagrasses meadows, rhodolith beds, submerged and emergent reefs, and a group of small volcanic islands. Abrolhos also has unique biological formations, such as the large mushroom-shaped reef formations – “chapeirões”, and unique geological formations, such as the “buracas” – distinctive depressions in the shelf plain (up to 20 metres deep and 70 metres wide). The region is an important breeding and/or fishing site for several flagship species, such as humpback whales, sea turtles and seabirds. Despite the biological relevance and uniqueness of this region, only 7% of it is within effective protected areas. Several factors put this great diversity in danger, such as large projects related to oil and cellulose.\nThe Vitória Trindade Chain, located on the central coast of Brazil, is composed of seven seamounts and an island complex (Archipelago of Trinidad and Martin Vaz). The substrate of the mountains and ocean islands is composed of living reefs of coralline algae, on which is also observed the presence of different species of corals, sponges and algae. The mountains and islands have a fauna of reef fish that is still preserved, with a significant biomass and abundance of species, harbouring many sharks and spawning aggregation phenomena of important fishery resources. Moreover, the fish fauna of the Vitória e Trindade Chain has at least 11 endemic species on their reefs. Also, this area is the only breeding site for three endemic populations of seabirds, the Trindade Petrel (Pterodroma arminjoniana), the Atlantic Lesser Frigatebird (Fregata minor nicolli), and the Atlantic Greater Frigatebird (Fregata ariel trinitiatis). In the meantime, this environment can be considered high in uniqueness, importance for the life cycle of many species, important for endangered species, highly sensitive, high in biological productivity, and relatively well kept. Despite all this wealth and uniqueness, the increase in fishing effort, which has already caused extinctions of species in several other Brazilian islands and now focuses on this area, threatens sharks and other large carnivores.

Its configuration and size are the outcomes of two independent spreading processes: one that formed the North Atlantic in the early Mesozoic nearly 200 million years ago, and another that originated the South Atlantic, 100 million years later (Fairhead & Wilson, 2004). As a consequence, northern and southern sectors of the Atlantic not only diverged in age but also in their spreading direction, connectivity with other oceans and oceanographic patterns. Yet they remained connected near the Equator by a relatively narrow area defined as the Equatorial Atlantic and characterized by (a) multiple 1000 – 6000 m deep benthic habitats formed by the Mid-Atlantic ridge and the Equatorial Fracture Zone, (b) the interference of circulation patterns of deep water masses of the Atlantic and (c) the influence of surface oceanographic processes, including a seasonal phytoplankton bloom that affect both pelagic and benthic ecosystems. These features combined differentiate the equatorial zone from the adjacent north and south oceanic basins, and particularly from their oligotrophic tropical and subtropical pelagic systems. In that sense the Equatorial Atlantic is unique in the Atlantic Ocean, as also supported by both empirically shown and modeled patterns of biodiversity. It is worth noting that the area also includes a Mid-Atlantic ridge-associated group of islets, the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, whose coastal fauna and flora has been connected with oceanic dispersal processes among the Atlantic’s continental margins and oceanic islands (see reviews in Vianna et al., 2009 and Vaske Jr. 2010) and a recently mapped hydrothermal vent field (Devey et al., 2005).\nComprehensive descriptions of seafloor features and major oceanographic and productivity patterns are available in the literature and derive from large-scale oceanographic programmes and satellite imagery analysis (e.g., Ocean Drilling Program, InterRidge, IOC – GOOS, UK Atlantic Meridional Transect - AMT and others).  Some of these programmes also include general data on diversity, distribution and abundance of zooplankton, pelagic fish and cephalopods that cover the Equatorial as well as adjacent tropical and subtropical areas of the North and South Atlantic (e.g. Gibbons, 1997; Rosa et al., 2008; Kobilianski et al., 2011). Particular data sets also derive from a long-standing research programme on the coastal areas and pelagic system in the vicinity of the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago (ProArquipelago - Vianna et al., 2009 and Vaske Jr. 2010) and from pelagic fishing for large predators (tunas, billfishes, sharks) concentrated at the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT, www.iccat.org). Other data sets on seabird and sea turtle distribution and migrations complement our understanding of the biological relevance of the Equatorial Atlantic for nekton communities (e.g. Witt et al., 2011). Finally, data on bathy- and benthopelagic as well as benthic fauna are less comprehensive. Yet recent large-scale surveys derived from the Census of Marine Life programme (e.g., MAR-ECO – http://www.mar-eco.no; ChEss –http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/chess/) have produced novel and relevant information on the biota associated with Equatorial Atlantic deep habitats.\nThe Equatorial Atlantic combines a wide spectra of historical, geological, oceanographic and biodiversity features, both in the pelagic and benthic domains, that that lead to this area being described as an EBSA in the Atlantic Ocean. This area extends mostly beyond the jurisdiction of Atlantic coastal countries, and the recognition of its importance seems crucial for eventual conservation initiatives in the high seas.",

The shelf width varies along the coast, reaching minimums of 8 km (off Bahia state), to over 80 km (north Ceará). The continental shelf-edge zone is a marine ecotone where different components of the demersal, benthic and benthopelagic communities of the continental shelf, upper slope and adjacent pelagic biota coexist in a narrow strip along the continental margin. This ecotone, characterized by high population densities and species richness, provides a concentration of diverse fishing resources over a relatively narrow area, easily accessible to local artisanal fleets and sustaining important traditional multispecific reef fisheries. Biogenic reef formations associated with outer shelf channels, ravines and deeper canyons represent important traditional fishing grounds. The north-eastern Brazilian shelf-edge zone contains distinct habitats and unusual geomorphological features such as shelf-edge reefs that represent a last refuge for some rare or endemic reef fishes distributed across the continental margin, including threatened (IUCN) commercial species of the snapper-grouper complex, currently depleted within the Brazilian EEZ. The shelf-edge harbours critical habitats for the life cycle of many sea turtles, whales, sharks and reef fish species, including migratory corridors and fish spawning aggregation sites that are extremely vulnerable to human pressures, such as intensive commercial and recreational fishing, shipping and offshore oil and gas exploitation, all activities currently expanding off the Brazilian coast. The area covers part of the most important seabird migration corridor in the Atlantic, a site which qualifies as a Birdlife Important Bird Area (IBA) for both threatened species and congregations. This region corresponds to a portion of the breeding ground of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) off the north-eastern coast of Brazil. It also corresponds to an important habitat of various relatively low-density cetacean populations, including Bryde’s whales (Balaenoptera cf. edeni), dwarf minke whales (B. acutorostrata), and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus).  The Assessment of the Sustainable Yield of the Living Resources in the Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone Program    (REVIZEE Program ) has extensively sampled this area meeting EBSA criteria. Results indicated great bottom heterogeneity of the shelf and slope, with the occurrence of important canyons, which provide structural complexity and varied micro-habitats, allowing a greater number of benthic species in the area. Recent studies reinforce the hypotheses of a faunal corridor for reef fish species associated with deep reef formations along the shelf-edge zone in the South American continental margin, connecting the south-western Atlantic and the Caribbean.",

The Sargasso Sea is home to an iconic pelagic ecosystem with the floating Sargassum seaweeds, the world’s only holopelagic algae, as its cornerstone. It hosts a diverse community of associated organisms that includes ten endemic species, and provides essential habitat for key life stages of a wide diversity of species, many of which are endangered or threatened.

A variety of oceanographic processes impact productivity and species diversity, and the area plays a disproportionately large role in global ocean processes of oxygen production and carbon sequestration. The sea floor has two large seamount chains, home to specialized, fragile and endemic communities, and models predict the presence of numerous other isolated seamounts. Both pelagic and benthic ecosystems are impacted by a range of human activities, and the currents of the gyre act to concentrate pollutants.

Year-to-year variability in ocean-ice-atmosphere interact ion leads to strong inter-annual variability in the intensity and extent of convection.

The coastal Chukchi Sea differs from the seas of the Siberian shelf by its increased pelagic primary production and the flux of carbon to the sea floor (Vetrov and Romakevich, 2011). Chaun Bay and other inlets and lagoons harbour kelp communities (Golikov et al., 1994; 2009), which significantly increase productivity in coastal areas compared to most part of the Siberian shelf seas. Benthic biomass in the coastal areas is high in protected bays and inlets (Sirenko et al., 2009; Denisenko, 2010; Denisenko et al., 2010). Some communities are particularly rare, i.e., the fucoid communities, kelp and mussel beds along the eastern shore of Chaun Bay, which \nare relics of the warmer Holocene conditions (Golikov et al., 1994). \n\nShallow bays, with their specific regime, and the marshes along the coast serve as staging, moulting and nesting areas for numerous aquatic birds, including eiders, long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis) and alcids (Gavrilo and Popov, 2011).

Most of the area is filled by water originating from the Bering Sea, which enters through the Bering Strait in seasonal pulses and circulates in the Chukchi Sea (Zalogin and Kosarev, 1999). There is a large, stable gyre in the eastern part of this area (known as the Ratmanov Gyre), which stabilizes the conditions, provides a significant supply of nutrients and high primary production that fluxes to the bottom, and is the basis for stable and persistent benthic communities (Sirenko et al., 2009a). The biomass of benthic infauna and epifauna is very high (Speer and Laughlin, 2011: A). Around Wrangel Island, landfast ice and polynyas are formed. The formation of polynyas off Wrangel Island is a result of the interaction between the Arctic and the Siberian anticyclones. The area is largely untouched by human activities. \n\nThis area provides a spring migratory pathway for hundreds of bowhead whales daily, as well as beluga whales, polar bears, Pacific walrus and gray whales during summer and autumn (Speer and Laughlin, 2011: A).

Laptev polynyas support a chain of colonies dominated by thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia) and black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla).

Another feature supporting high productivity is a marginal ice zone, which moves in the course of a season in the same area. The area provides feeding grounds for common species of Barents Sea pinnipeds and ceatceans as well as breeding grounds for bearded (Erignathus barbatus) and ringed (Phoca hispida) seals. The system of shore leads and drift ice up along the west coast of Novaya Zemlya is supposed to constitute a spring migration route for beluga of the Kara stock and possibly for Atlantic walrus.\n\nThe high productivity of this marine area supports the largest seabird colonies in the North-East Atlantic, including a large breeding population of common eiders. Rare and threatened species/habitats include staging and moulting grounds for the threatened Steller's eider and longtailed duck (Speers and Laughlin, 2010). Benthic biomass in some places exceeds 1000 g/m2 at the western shore, and the area thus serves as an important feeding ground for Atlantic walruses.

It differs from the rest of the Barents Sea by its more continental climate, lower salinity, shallow depths and lowland shores. The most outstanding environmental feature is the Pechora River — the second-largest river draining into the European part of the Arctic Ocean. Its discharge influences this area and justifies certain biological features. The Pechora Sea is known to hold rich and highly productive benthic communities supported by considerable nutrient influx transported by the Pechora River. The benthic fauna numbers more than 600 taxa. Total biomass recorded at the Kolguev shallow, in the Kara and Yugor Shar straits, exceeds 500 mg/m2, which is the highest value found in the Barents Sea. This provides a good food base for benthic-feeding animals like sea ducks and walruses. Waterbirds represent another remarkable biological feature of the area. The Pechora Sea is located in the centre of the East Atlantic flyway and is a key stopover site for the majority of waterfowl species during the final stages of their migrations. Most of the waterfowl and other aquatic birds do not pass the area in transit but make extensive use of the rich food resources of sea shoals and sheltered bays, the littoral zone and adjacent coasts. Altogether, about 130 bird species are observed there. The Pechora Sea serves as a key habitat for Atlantic walrus and provides an important feeding ground and migration path for beluga whales (IUCN VU). Polar bears inhabit the area throughout the year. In addition to this, the Pechora Sea basin supports the only European stock of Arctic cisco (Coregonus autumnalis) and is an important migration area for the Pechora Atlantic salmon stock.

It spreads cold water to the south and fills the deep areas \nof the entire White Sea and retains sub-zero temperatures all year round (Timonov, 1950; Pantyulin, 2003; Kosobokova et al., 2004). These specific conditions form a biotic boundary that limits dispersal of fauna from outside the area into the White Sea (Derjugin, 1928; Naumov, 2006; Solyanko et al., 2011). \n\nDeep areas filled with cold water provide habitats for pelagic and benthic biota, while upper layers and shallow areas host typical boreal fauna and macrophyte flora (i.e., kelp and seagrass) (Derjugin, 1928; Berger and Naumov, 2001; Naumov, 2001). In certain areas, the number of macrobenthic species exceeds 460 (Spiridonov et al., 2012), while number of phytoplankton species in the White Sea exceeds 440 (Ilyash et al., 2013). The White Sea harbours two endemic subspecies of fish, migration routes of Atlantic salmon and their abundant stocks (Studenov, 1991, 2011). \n\nBays and islands of the White sea provide breeding habitats for 17 species of aquatic birds (Semashko et al., 2012) and serve as nesting areas of common eiders (Somateria molissima). This area overlaps with the East Atlantic flyway and thus has huge importance as a migration corridor and staging area (Lehikoinen et al., 2006). The polynyas that develop in winter are important wintering grounds for several seabird species (Krasnov et al., 2010, 2011). With regards to marine mammals, the White Sea contains important feeding, whelping and moulting areas of harp seals (Pagophilus groenladicus) (Melentyev and Chernook, 2009; Svetochev and Svetocheva, 2011) and extremely important mating grounds of beluga whales (Delphinapterus beluga) (Svetochev and Sveticheva, 2011).",

The area is found along the southern continental margin of Liberia. Part of Cape Mount, specifically Semberhun, Banjor Beach in Montserrado and Baford Bay were identified as turtle-breeding grounds, but the shoreline between Rivercess and Greenville predominates over the rest of the area, hence the reason for its description. The spawning ground is linked to the estuary of Sanquin River, which transports pieces of decayed wooden material that provide shelter and food for the inhabitants.\n\nMore female marine turtles were found in the area of interest than male turtles, probably due to its high temperature.
