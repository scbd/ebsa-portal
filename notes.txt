I have done some major changes in the website, so I will send it to you right away via Dropbox.

The About section is complete with the new text, there's one missing link, I will contact Joseph about it to correct, but the rest is fine. Just when you finished to upload it, could you send it to him so he can review as soon as possible? -- DONE

I did not modify the Partners page, I am waiting for Joseph's new logos and texts. -- Awaiting

There is a minor change in the footer. I added the four links at the bottom, you will see it clearly, it a <p class="copyright"> tag, I have changed to a tag and I added 3 more. -- DONE

I also updated the Guidance in applying criteria, the article part.

I added the "more" link on the home page tables. -- DONE

And finally, (I am terribly sorry for that) I remove all the responsiveness of the website, I had to change all class of the div col-lg-* for col-xs-*. This is very major, I don't know how you want to proceed with that in the website. I send to you right away the entire the website, so you can have a overview, and later I will send you the precise changes I have made, as you asked me yesterday(for the home page, the resources and the footer).

I have to leave now, but you can email me, and I will be able to reply later today.

Thank you,

A few quick comments, that hopefully shouldn't take too long to address:
--Also, on this page, please make a downloadable screenshot of the report referred to in the last line of the page -- SATYA


--For a few of the pages, namely "Background on EBSA process", "Relevant Decisions of the Conference of the Parties to the CBD", and Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and Aichi Biodiversity Targets," there is lots of unused space because the text is relegated to the right.  It would be good to spread this text out and use this blank space under the photos. -- SATYA

--Under "Workshop Report", we have the report of the North Pacific Regional EBSA workshop available.  It's located at http://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/mar/ebsa-np-01/official/ebsa-np-01-04-en.pdf.  Please put this screenshot and link on the page -- SATYA

--Also the search function doesn't work--Will this come later? -- STEVE
