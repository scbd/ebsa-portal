Soon after,\n                in May 1989, it established the Ad Hoc Working Group of\n                Technical and Legal Experts to prepare an international legal\n                instrument for the conservation and sustainable use of\n                biological diversity. The experts were to take into account\n                \"the need to share costs and benefits between developed and\n                developing countries\" as well as \"ways and means to support\n                innovation by local people\". By February 1991, the Ad Hoc\n                Working Group had become knownas the Intergovernmental\n                Negotiating Committee. Its work culminated on 22 May 1992 with\n                the Nairobi Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of\n                the Convention on Biological Diversity.","xpath":"div%3Ediv%3Ediv%3Ediv%3Ediv%3Anth-child(2)%3Ediv%3Anth-child(2)%3Ediv%3Ediv%3Ep%3Anth-child(4)","tabName":"Convention on Biological Diversity","tabHash":"cbd","pageName":"about","id":50},{"body":"The Convention was opened for signature on 5 June 1992 at\n                  the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development\n                  (the Rio \"Earth Summit\").
