                <h2>Background on the EBSA Process</h2>

                <div class="push20"></div>

                <p>The EBSAs are special areas in the ocean that serve
                important purposes, in one way or another, to support the
                healthy functioning of oceans and the many services that it
                provides.</p>

                <div class="col-xs-5 list-themes"><img alt=
                "EBSAs regions on the world" class="border-img" src=
                "img/about-1.jpg"></div>

                <p>The ocean is under increasing threat from various human
                activities. The most pressing threats come from overﬁshing,
                destructive ﬁshing practices, and illegal, unreported and
                unregulated ﬁshing activities. Other emerging problems include
                marine debris, ship-based marine pollution, transfer of alien
                invasive species, illegal dumping and the legacy of historical
                dumping, seabed mineral extraction, and noise pollution.</p>

                <p>The combined impacts of these threats as well as the
                potential impacts of climate change and ocean acidiﬁcation have
                placed thousands of species at risk of extinction, and have
                impaired the structure, function, productivity and resilience
                of marine ecosystems.</p>

                <p>At the present time, the world's oceans are seriously
                underprotected, with only approximately 0.8% of the oceans and
                6% of territorial seas being within protected area systems.
                Measures are being taken to increase protection and sustainable
                management. In order to support effective policy action by
                countries and competent international and regional
                organizations, it is critical to build a sound understanding of
                the most ecologically and biologically important ocean areas
                that support healthy marine ecosystems.</p>

                <h4>Scientific Criteria for Identifying Ecologically or
                Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs)</h4>

                <p>In 2008, the ninth meeting of the Conference of the Parties
                to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 9) adopted the
                following scientific criteria for identifying ecologically or
                biologically significant marine areas in need of protection in
                open-ocean waters and deep-sea habitats.</p>

                <p>For more details on the EBSA criteria, please see: <a href=
                "https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/mar/ebsaws-2014-01/other/ebsaws-2014-01-azores-brochure-en.pdf"

                <h4>CBD scientific criteria for ecologically or biologically
                significant areas (EBSAs) (annex I, decision IX/20)</h4>

                <ol>
                  <li>Uniqueness or Rarity</li>

                  <li>Special importance for life history stages of
                  species</li>

                  <li>Importance for threatened, endangered or declining
                  species and/or habitats</li>

                  <li>Vulnerability, Fragility, Sensitivity, or Slow
                  recovery</li>

                  <li>Biological Productivity</li>

                  <li>Biological Diversity</li>

                  <li>Naturalness</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Application of Scientific Criteria for EBSAs</h4>

                <p>In 2010, COP 10 noted that the application of the EBSA
                criteria is a scientific and technical exercise, that areas
                found to meet the criteria may require enhanced conservation
                and management measures, and that this can be achieved through
                a variety of means, including marine protected areas and impact
                assessments. The COP further noted that the application of the
                EBSA criteria is an open and evolving process that should be
                continued to allow ongoing improvement and updating as improved
                scientific and technical information becomes available in each
                region.</p>

                <h4>Who Identifies EBSAs</h4>

                <p>COP 10 emphasized that the identification of EBSAs and the
                selection of conservation and management measures is a matter
                for States and competent intergovernmental organizations, in
                accordance with international law, including the UN Convention
                on the Law of the Sea.</p>

                <h4>Dataset for Identifying EBSAs</h4>

                <p>COP 10 emphasized that identification of EBSAs should use
                the best available scientific and technical information and
                integrate the traditional, scientific, technical, and
                technological knowledge of indigenous and local communities,
                and requested the Executive Secretary to facilitate
                availability and interoperability of the best available marine
                and coastal biodiversity data sets and information across
                global, regional and national scales.</p>

                <h4>Scientific Description of EBSAs at the Regional Level</h4>

                <p>COP 10 requested the Executive Secretary to organize a
                series of regional workshops with a primary objective to
                facilitate the description of EBSAs through application of
                scientific criteria as well as other relevant compatible and
                complementary nationally and intergovernmentally agreed
                scientific criteria, as well as the scientific guidance for the
                application of EBSA criteria.</p>

                <h4>Consideration by COP of the Report on Description of Areas
                Meeting EBSA Criteria and Submission of the Report to UNGA
                Processes</h4>

                <p>COP 10 requested the Subsidiary Body on Scientific,
                Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) to prepare reports
                based on scientific and technical evaluation of information
                from the regional workshops, setting out details of areas that
                meet the scientific criteria for consideration in a transparent
                manner by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, with
                a view to include the report in the repository and submit the
                report to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA),
                particularly the Ad Hoc Open ended Informal Working Group, as
                well as relevant international organizations, Parties and other
                Governments.</p>

                <h4>Cooperation on Managing Areas Meeting EBSA Criteria</h4>

                <p>COP 10 encouraged Parties, other Governments and competent
                intergovernmental organizations to cooperate collectively or on
                a regional or subregional basis, to identify and adopt
                appropriate measures for conservation conservation and
                sustainable use in relation to EBSAs, including by establishing
                representative networks of marine protected areas in accordance
                with international law, including the United Nations Convention
                on the Law of the Sea, and based on best scientific information
                available, and to inform the relevant processes within the
                UNGA.</p>

                <h4>Regional Workshops to Facilitate Description of Areas
                Meeting EBSA Criteria</h4>

                <p>Pursuant to the request by COP 10, the Executive Secretary
                has convened a series of regional workshops in the following
                regions:</p>

                <ul class="nospace">

                <h2>Convention on Biological Diversity</h2>

                <div class="push20"></div>

                <p>The Earth's biological resources are vital to humanity's
                economic and social development. As a result, there is a
                growing recognition that biological diversity is a global asset
                of tremendous value to present and future generations. At the
                same time, the threat to species and ecosystems has never been
                so great as it is today. Species extinction caused by human
                activities continues at an alarming rate.</p>

                <p>In response, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
                convened the Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological
                Diversity in November 1988 to explore the need for an.
                international convention on biological diversity. Soon after,
                in May 1989, it established the Ad Hoc Working Group of
                Technical and Legal Experts to prepare an international legal
                instrument for the conservation and sustainable use of
                biological diversity. The experts were to take into account
                "the need to share costs and benefits between developed and
                developing countries" as well as "ways and means to support
                innovation by local people". By February 1991, the Ad Hoc
                Working Group had become knownas the Intergovernmental
                Negotiating Committee. Its work culminated on 22 May 1992 with
                the Nairobi Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of
                the Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>

                <div class="col-xs-7">
                  <p>The Convention was opened for signature on 5 June 1992 at
                  the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development
                  (the Rio "Earth Summit"). It remained open for signature
                  until 4 June 1993, by which time it had received 168
                  signatures. The Convention entered into force on 29 December
                  1993, which was 90 days after the 30th ratification. The
                  first session of the Conference of the Parties was scheduled
                  for 28 November – 9 December 1994 in the Bahamas.</p>

                  <p>The Convention on Biological Diversity was inspired by the
                  world community's growing commitment to sustainable
                  development. It represents a dramatic step forward in the
                  conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of
                  its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of
                  benefits arising from the use of genetic resources.</p>

                <p>The Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on
                Biological Diversity has provided guidance and support for the
                Ecologically and Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs)
                since 2008 through a number of decisions.</p>

                <h4>Decision IX/20</h4>

                <p><span class="important">EBSA Scientific Criteria</span><br>
                In <a href=
                "http://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=11663"
                target="_blank">decision IX/20</a>, the Conference of the
                Parties to the CBD adopted the scientific criteria for
                identifying ecologically or biologically significant marine
                areas in need of protection in open-ocean waters and deep-sea
                habitats.</p>

                <p>For more details on the EBSA criteria, please see: <a href=
                "https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/mar/ebsaws-2014-01/other/ebsaws-2014-01-azores-brochure-en.pdf"

                <p><span class="important">Integrating Traditional, Scientific,
                Technical and Technological Knowledge</span><br>
                In this decision, the COP also called on Parties to integrate
                the traditional, scientific, technical and technological
                knowledge of indigenous and local communities, consistent with
                Article 8(j) of the Convention, and to ensure the integration
                of social and cultural criteria and other aspects for the
                identification of marine areas in need of protection as well as
                the establishment and management of marine protected areas
                (paragraph 27).</p>

                <h4>Decision X/29</h4>

                <p><span class="important">Regional EBSA Workshops</span><br>
                At its tenth meeting, the Conference of the Parties adopted
                decision X/29, which requested the CBD Executive Secretary to
                organize a series of regional workshops to facilitate the
                description of ecologically or biologically significant marine
                areas through application of scientific criteria. The COP
                requested the Executive Secretary to work with Parties and
                other Governments as well as competent organizations and
                regional initiatives, such as the Food and Agriculture
                Organization of the United Nations (FAO), regional seas
                conventions and action plans, and, where appropriate, regional
                fisheries management organizations (RFMOs), in organizing these
                regional workshops (paragraph 36).</p>

                <p>Thus far, regional workshops have been organized in the
                following regions:</p>

                <ul class="nospace">
                  <li>Western South Pacific</li>

                  <li>Wider Caribbean & Western Mid-Atlantic</li>

                Technical and Technological Knowledge</span><br>
                The decision emphasized that the identification of EBSAs should
                use the best available scientific and technical information

                communities, consistent with Article 8(j) of the Convention
                (paragraph 34). The decision also requested the Executive
                Secretary to undertake a study to identify specific elements
                for integrating the traditional, scientific, technical and
                technological knowledge of indigenous and local communities,
                and social and cultural criteria and other aspects in the

                the COP invited the Global Environment Facility and other
                donors and funding agencies to extend support for
                capacity-building to developing countries, in particular the
                least developed countries and small island developing States,
                as well as countries with economies in transition, in order to
                identify EBSAs, and develop appropriate protection measures in
                these areas (paragraph 38).</p>

                global sustainable development, the Conference of the Parties
                to the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted a revised and
                updated Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, including the Aichi
                Biodiversity Targets, for the 2011-2020 period, at its tenth
                meeting held from 18 to 29 October 2010, in Nagoya, Aichi
                Prefecture, Japan.</p>

                <p>This Strategic Plan provides an overarching framework on
                biodiversity, not only for the biodiversity-related
                conventions, but for the entire United Nations system.</p>
