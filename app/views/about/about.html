                <h2>Background on the EBSA Process</h2>
                <div class="push15"></div>

                <p>The EBSAs are special areas in the ocean that serve important purposes, in one way or another, to support the healthy functioning of oceans and the many services that it provides.</p>

                <p>The ocean is under increasing threat from various human activities. The most pressing threats come from overﬁshing, destructive ﬁshing practices, and illegal, unreported and unregulated ﬁshing activities. Other emerging problems include marine debris, ship-based marine pollution, transfer of alien invasive species, illegal dumping and the legacy of historical dumping, seabed  mineral extraction, and noise pollution.</p>

                <p>The combined impacts of these threats as well as the potential impacts of climate change and ocean acidiﬁcation have placed thousands of species at risk of extinction, and have impaired the structure, function, productivity and resilience of marine ecosystems.</p>
                <p>At the present time, the world's oceans are seriously underprotected, with only approximately 0.8% of the oceans and 6% of territorial seas being within protected area systems. Measures are being taken to increase protection and sustainable management. In order to support effective policy action by countries and competent international and regional organizations, it is critical to build a sound understanding of the most ecologically and biologically important ocean areas that support healthy marine ecosystems.</p>
                <h4>Scientific Criteria for Identifying Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs)</h4>
                <p>In 2008, the ninth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 9) adopted the following scientific criteria for identifying ecologically or biologically significant marine areas in need of protection in open-ocean waters and deep-sea habitats.</p>

                <p>For more details on the EBSA criteria, please see: <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/mar/ebsaws-2014-01/other/ebsaws-2014-01-azores-brochure-en.pdf" target="_blank">cbd.int/doc/meetings/mar/ebsaws-2014-01/other/ebsaws-2014-01-azores-brochure-en.pdf</a></p>

                <h4>CBD scientific criteria for ecologically or biologically significant areas (EBSAs) (annex I, decision IX/20)</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Uniqueness or Rarity</li>
                  <li>Special importance for life history stages of species</li>
                  <li>Importance for threatened, endangered or declining species and/or habitats</li>
                  <li>Vulnerability, Fragility, Sensitivity, or Slow recovery</li>
                  <li>Biological Productivity</li>
                  <li>Biological Diversity</li>
                  <li>Naturalness</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Application of Scientific Criteria for EBSAs</h4>
                <p>In 2010, COP 10 noted that the application of the EBSA criteria is a scientific and technical exercise, that areas found to meet the criteria may require enhanced conservation and management measures, and that this can be achieved through a variety of means, including marine protected areas and impact assessments. The COP further noted that the application of the EBSA criteria is an open and evolving process that should be continued to allow ongoing improvement and updating as improved scientific and technical information becomes available in each region.</p>

                <h4>Who Identifies EBSAs</h4>
                <p>COP 10 emphasized that the identification of EBSAs and the selection of conservation and management measures is a matter for States and competent intergovernmental organizations, in accordance with international law, including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.</p>

                <h4>Dataset for Identifying EBSAs</h4>
                <p>COP 10 emphasized that identification of EBSAs should use the best available scientific and technical information and integrate the traditional, scientific, technical, and technological knowledge of indigenous and local communities, and requested the Executive Secretary to facilitate availability and interoperability of the best available marine and coastal biodiversity data sets and information across global, regional and national scales.</p>

                <h4>Scientific Description of EBSAs at the Regional Level</h4>
                <p>COP 10 requested the Executive Secretary to organize a series of regional workshops with a primary objective to facilitate the description of EBSAs through application of scientific criteria as well as other relevant compatible and complementary nationally and intergovernmentally agreed scientific criteria, as well as the scientific guidance for the application of EBSA criteria.</p>

                <h4>Endorsement by COP of the Report on Description of Areas Meeting EBSA Criteria and Submission of the Report to UNGA Processes</h4>
                <p>COP 10 requested the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) to prepare reports based on scientific and technical evaluation of information from the regional workshops, setting out details of areas that meet the scientific criteria for consideration and endorsement in a transparent manner by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, with a view to include the endorsed report in the repository and submit the endorsed report to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), particularly the Ad Hoc Open ended Informal Working Group, as well as relevant international organizations, Parties and other Governments.</p>

                <h4>Cooperation on Managing Areas Meeting EBSA Criteria</h4>
                <p>COP 10 encouraged Parties, other Governments and competent intergovernmental organizations to cooperate collectively or on a regional or subregional basis, to identify and adopt appropriate measures for conservation conservation and sustainable use in relation to EBSAs, including by establishing representative networks of marine protected areas in accordance with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and based on best scientific information available, and to inform the relevant processes within the UNGA.</p>

                <h4>Regional Workshops to Facilitate Description of Areas Meeting EBSA Criteria</h4>
                <p>Pursuant to the request by COP 10, the Executive Secretary has convened a series of regional workshops in the following regions:</p>
                <ul class="nospace">
                  <li>Western South Pacific</li>
                  <li>Wider Caribbean & Western Mid-Atlantic</li>
                  <li>Southern Indian Ocean</li>
                  <li>Eastern Tropical & Temperate Pacific</li>
                  <li>North Pacific</li>

                <h2>Convention on Biological Diversity </h2>
                <div class="push15"></div>

                <p>The Earth's biological resources are vital to humanity's economic and social development. As a result, there is a growing recognition that biological diversity is a global asset of tremendous value to present and future generations. At the same time, the threat to species and ecosystems has never been so great as it is today. Species extinction caused by human activities continues at an alarming rate.</p>

                <p>In response, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) convened the Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological Diversity in November 1988 to explore the need for an. international convention on biological diversity. Soon after, in May 1989, it established the Ad Hoc Working Group of Technical and Legal Experts to prepare an international legal instrument for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. The experts were to take into account "the need to share costs and benefits between developed and developing countries" as well as "ways and means to support innovation by local people". By February 1991, the Ad Hoc Working Group had become known as the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee. Its work culminated on 22 May 1992 with the Nairobi Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>

                <p>The Convention was opened for signature on 5 June 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio "Earth Summit"). It remained open for signature until 4 June 1993, by which time it had received 168 signatures. The Convention entered into force on 29 December 1993, which was 90 days after the 30th ratification. The first session of the Conference of the Parties was scheduled for 28 November – 9 December 1994 in the Bahamas.</p>

                <p>The Convention on Biological Diversity was inspired by the world community's growing commitment to sustainable development. It represents a dramatic step forward in the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources.</p>

                <h2>Relevant Decisions of the Conference of the Parties to the CBD</h2>
                <div class="push15"></div>

                <p>The Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity has provided guidance and support for the Ecologically and Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs) since 2008 through a number of decisions.</p>

                <h4>Decision IX/20</h4>
                <p class="important">EBSA Scientific Criteria</p>
                <p>In <a href="http://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=11663" target="_blank">decision IX/20</a>, the Conference of the Parties to the CBD adopted the scientific criteria for identifying ecologically or biologically significant marine areas in need of protection in open-ocean waters and deep-sea habitats.</p>

                <p>For more details on the EBSA criteria, please see: <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/mar/ebsaws-2014-01/other/ebsaws-2014-01-azores-brochure-en.pdf" target="_blank">www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/mar/ebsaws-2014-01/other/ebsaws-2014-01-azores-brochure-en.pdf</a></p>

                <p class="important">Integrating Traditional, Scientific, Technical and Technological Knowledge</p>                                <p>In this decision, the COP also called on Parties to integrate the traditional, scientific, technical and technological knowledge of indigenous and local communities, consistent with Article 8(j) of the Convention, and to ensure the integration of social and cultural criteria and other aspects for the identification of marine areas in need of protection as well as the establishment and management of marine protected areas (paragraph 27).</p>

                <h4>Decision X/29</h4>
                <p class="important">Regional EBSA Workshops</p>
                <p>At its tenth meeting, the Conference of the Parties adopted decision X/29, which requested the CBD Executive Secretary to organize a series of regional workshops to facilitate the description of ecologically or biologically significant marine areas through application of scientific criteria. The COP requested the Executive Secretary to work with Parties and other Governments as well as competent organizations and regional initiatives, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), regional seas conventions and action plans, and, where appropriate, regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs), in organizing these regional workshops (paragraph 36).</p>

                <p>Thus far, regional workshops have been organized in the following regions:</p>
                <ul class="nospace">
                  <li>Western South Pacific</li>
                  <li>Wider Caribbean & Western Mid-Atlantic</li>
                  <li>Southern Indian Ocean</li>
                  <li>Eastern Tropical & Temperate Pacific</li>

                <p class="important">Integrating Traditional, Scientific, Technical and Technological Knowledge</p>
                <p>The decision emphasized that the identification of EBSAs should use the best available scientific and technical information and, as appropriate, integrate the traditional scientific, technical, and technological knowledge of indigenous and local communities, consistent with Article 8(j) of the Convention (paragraph 34). The decision also requested the Executive Secretary to undertake a study to identify specific elements for integrating the traditional, scientific, technical and technological knowledge of indigenous and local communities, and social and cultural criteria and other aspects in the application of the EBSA criteria (paragraph 47). Pursuant to this decision, a report on <span class="emphase">Identifying Specific Elements for Integrating the Traditional, Scientific, Technical and Technological Knowledge of Indigenous and Local Communities, and Social and Cultural Criteria and Other Aspects for the Application of Scientific Criteria for Identification of Ecologically or Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAS) As Well As the Establishment And Management of Marine Protected Areas (UNEP/CBD/SBSTTA/16/INF/10)</span> was produced and made available to the 16th meeting of SBSTTA. This report is available at: <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/sbstta/sbstta-16/information/sbstta-16-inf-10-en.pdf" target="_blank">cbd.int/doc/meetings/sbstta/sbstta-16/information/sbstta-16-inf-10-en.pdf</a></p>

                <p class="important">Capacity Building</p>
                <p>In this decision, COP also called for capacity building to support the application of the EBSA criteria. In this regard, the COP invited the Global Environment Facility and other donors and funding agencies to extend support for capacity-building to developing countries, in particular the least developed countries and small island developing States, as well as countries with economies in transition, in order to identify EBSAs, and develop appropriate protection measures in these areas (paragraph 38).</p>

                <p>In support of this decision, <span class="emphase">the Sustainable Ocean Initiative (SOI)</span> was born at the margins of COP 10, through the leadership of Japan, COP 10 Presidency, and in collaboration with various partners who were willing to provide the necessary expertise, technical and financial resources.</p>

                <p><span class="emphase">The Sustainable Ocean Initiative</span> aims to provide a global platform to build partnerships and enhance capacity to achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets related to marine and coastal biodiversity in a holistic manner by:</p>
                <ul class="nospace">

                <p class="important">EBSA Repository and Information-Sharing Mechanism</p>
                <p>Decision X/29 called on the Executive Secretary to establish a repository for scientific and technical information and experience related to the application of the scientific criteria on the identification of EBSAs, as well as other relevant compatible and complementary nationally and intergovernmentally agreed scientific criteria that shares information and harmonizes with similar initiatives, and to develop an information-sharing mechanism with similar initiatives (paragraph 39). This website and the CBD EBSA repository were developed pursuant to this request.</p>

                <p>The COP also invites Parties and other Governments to include in the repository, scientific and technical information and experience relating to the application of the EBSA criteria or other relevant compatible and complementary nationally and intergovernmentally agreed scientific criteria to areas within national jurisdiction (paragraph 43).</p>

                <p class="important">EBSA Training Materials</p>
                <p>The decision also requested the Executive Secretary to prepare a training manual and modules in the working languages of the United Nations which can be used to meet the capacity-building needs for identifying ecologically or biologically significant marine areas using the scientific criteria in annex I to <a href="http://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=11663" target="_blank">decision IX/20</a> having regard to other relevant compatible and complementary intergovernmentally agreed scientific criteria as well as the scientific guidance on the identification of marine areas beyond national jurisdiction (paragraph 40). In this regard, the Executive Secretary developed a <span class="emphase">Training Manual for the Description of Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAS) in Open-Ocean Waters and Deep-Sea Habitat</span> <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/sbstta/sbstta-16/information/sbstta-16-inf-09-en.pdf" target="_blank">(UNEP/CBD/SBSTTA/16/INF/9)</a>.</p>

                <p class="important">Encouraging Government to Adopt Management Measures</p>
                <p>The COP also encouraged Parties, other Governments and competent intergovernmental organizations to cooperate, as appropriate, collectively or on a regional or subregional basis, to identify and adopt appropriate measures for conservation and sustainable use in relation to the EBSAs, and in accordance with international law, including by establishing representative networks of marine protected areas in accordance with international law, and based on best scientific information available (paragraph 32).</p>

                <h4>Decision XI/17</h4>
                <p class="important">Additional Regional EBSA Workshops</p>
                <p>In decision XI/17, the COP requested the CBD Executive Secretary to further collaborate with Parties, other Governments, competent organizations, and global and regional initiatives to further collaborate with Parties, other Governments, competent organizations, and global and regional initiatives (paragraph 12).</p>

                <p class="important">Capacity Building for EBSAs</p>
                <p>This decision also addressed the need to build capacity to describe and identify EBSAs. COP requested the Executive Secretary to further develop the EBSA training manual and modules <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/sbstta/sbstta-16/information/sbstta-16-inf-09-en.pdf" target="_blank">(UNEP/CBD/SBSTTA/16/INF/9)</a> and, once refined, to translate them into the official United Nations languages. The COP also invited Parties, other Governments and United Nations specialized agencies to use these training materials and make necessary resources to enhance the scientific and technical capacity within respective countries and regions with regard to describing areas that meet the criteria for EBSAs (paragraph 19). The COP also requested the Executive Secretary to collaborate with Parties, other Governments and relevant organizations to strengthen the capacities of countries in scientific staff training (paragraph 20), and to organize training workshops using the training materials in support of future scientific description of areas that meet the criteria for EBSAs at national and regional levels as well as identification of EBSAs by States and competent intergovernmental organizations (paragraph 21). Additionally, the COP urged Parties and invited other Governments, the financial mechanism, and funding organizations, as appropriate, to provide adequate, timely, and sustainable support to the implementation of training and capacity-building and other activities related to EBSAs, especially for developing countries, in particular least developed countries and small island developing States, and Parties with economies in transition, including countries with upwelling systems, and, as appropriate, indigenous and local communities (paragraph 22).</p>

                <p class="important">Further Development of EBSA Repository and Information-Sharing Mechanism</p>
                <p>The COP also requested the Executive Secretary to further develop the prototype repository and the information-sharing mechanism into a fully functional repository and information-sharing mechanism  (paragraph 16). COP also encouraged Parties, other Governments and intergovernmental organizations to develop regional data inventories with metadata and link them to the EBSA information-sharing mechanism (paragraph 17). In addition, COP requested Parties and other Governments to provide scientific and technical information and experience relating to the application of the criteria for EBSAs or other relevant compatible and complementary nationally and intergovernmentally agreed scientific criteria in areas within national jurisdiction for inclusion in the repository or information-sharing mechanism (paragraph 18).</p>

                <h2>Strategic plan for Biodiversity 2011 - 2020 and Aichi Biodiversity Targets</h2>
                <div class="push15"></div>

                <p>In light of new and expanded challenges that have emerged and an enhanced understanding of the value of biodiversity to global sustainable development, the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted a revised and updated Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, for the 2011-2020 period, at its tenth meeting held from 18 to 29 October 2010, in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan.</p>

                <p>This Strategic Plan provides an overarching framework on biodiversity, not only for the biodiversity-related conventions, but for the entire United Nations system. </p>

                <p>The vision of the Strategic Plan is:<br />
                  <blockquote class="emphase">"Living in Harmony with Nature" where "By 2050, biodiversity is valued, conserved, restored and wisely used, maintaining ecosystem services, sustaining a healthy planet and delivering benefits essential for all people."</blockquote></p>
                  <p>The Strategic Plan is organized under 5 Strategic Goals and 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, as follows:</p>

                  <p><span class="important">Strategic Goal A:</span> Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society</p>

                  <p><span class="important">Target 1</span><br />By 2020, at the latest, people are aware of the values of biodiversity and the steps they can take to conserve and use it sustainably.</p>

                  <p><span class="important">Target 2</span><br />By 2020, at the latest, biodiversity values have been integrated into national and local development and poverty reduction strategies and planning processes and are being incorporated into national accounting, as appropriate, and reporting systems.</p>

                  <p><span class="important">Target 3</span><br />By 2020, at the latest, incentives, including subsidies, harmful to biodiversity are eliminated, phased out or reformed in order to minimize or avoid negative impacts, and positive incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity are developed and applied, consistent and in harmony with the Convention and other relevant international obligations, taking into account national socio economic conditions.</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Target 4</span><br />By 2020, at the latest, Governments, business and stakeholders at all levels have taken steps to achieve or have implemented plans for sustainable production and consumption and have kept the impacts of use of natural resources well within safe ecological limits.</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Strategic Goal B:</span> Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote sustainable use</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Target 5</span><br />By 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced.</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Target 6</span><br />By 2020 all fish and invertebrate stocks and aquatic plants are managed and harvested sustainably, legally and applying ecosystem based approaches, so that overfishing is avoided, recovery plans and measures are in place for all depleted species, fisheries have no significant adverse impacts on threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems and the impacts of fisheries on stocks, species and ecosystems are within safe ecological limits.</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Target 7</span><br />By 2020 areas under agriculture, aquaculture and forestry are managed sustainably, ensuring conservation of biodiversity.</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Target 8</span><br />By 2020, pollution, including from excess nutrients, has been brought to levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem function and biodiversity.</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Target 9</span><br />By 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment.</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Target 10</span><br />By 2015, the multiple anthropogenic pressures on coral reefs, and other vulnerable ecosystems impacted by climate change or ocean acidification are minimized, so as to maintain their integrity and functioning.</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Strategic Goal C:</span> To improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and genetic diversity</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Target 11</span><br />By 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Target 12</span><br />By 2020 the extinction of known threatened species has been prevented and their conservation status, particularly of those most in decline, has been improved and sustained.</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Target 13</span><br />By 2020, the genetic diversity of cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and of wild relatives, including other socio-economically as well as culturally valuable species, is maintained, and strategies have been developed and implemented for minimizing genetic erosion and safeguarding their genetic diversity.</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Strategic Goal D:</span> Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and ecosystem services</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Target 14</span><br />By 2020, ecosystems that provide essential services, including services related to water, and contribute to health, livelihoods and well-being, are restored and safeguarded, taking into account the needs of women, indigenous and local communities, and the poor and vulnerable.</p>
                  <p><span class="important">Target 15</span><br />By 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 per cent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combating desertification.</p>
