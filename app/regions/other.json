Studies have shown that as the ocean takes up atmospheric CO2, thereby mitigating the rate of climate change, there is a concomitant increase in ocean acidification.

Values of aragonite saturation states above 4 are considered optimal, between 3.5 and 4 are considered marginal, 3-3.5 very marginal, and no corals historically are found below values of 3 (Guinotte et al. 2003). In the Pacific the value of aragonite saturation state in surface waters on average has dropped from around 4.5  to a current value of 3.7 over the last 200 years.\nCurrent measurements show an area to the east of American Samoa has the highest aragonite concentrations at present. As ocean acidification is driven primarily by the uptake of atmospheric CO2 the rates of decrease in aragonite saturation state are similar for the entire region. Consequently those areas with currently higher aragonite saturation states are the least affected for the longest period under climate change projections. Therefore, this area has special biological and ecological value as an area where the impact from ocean acidification will be slowest and from which recovery may potentially be the quickest."},"region":"other","url":"http://chm.cbd.int/database/record?documentID=200051"},"style":{"strokeColor":"#FFFFFF","fillColor":"#FFFFFF"}},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-162.856585,-13.620449],[-163.1157,-13.698184],[-163.310037,-13.581582],[-163.387772,-13.348378],[-163.387772,-13.141085],[-163.27117,-12.946748],[-163.076833,-12.894925],[-162.908408,-12.920837],[-162.77885,-12.985616],[-162.675204,-13.205864],[-162.739983,-13.477935],[-162.856585,-13.620449]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"dissolve":"South Pacific|TRUE","NAMEFINAL":"EBSA No. 18: Western South Pacific High Aragonite Saturation State Zone","EBSAFINAL":18,"INSIDEBND":"TRUE","EBSAREGION":"South Pacific","area_laea":477228041381,"area_mea":533904568445,"area_cea":44,"merge":"","Workshop":"No regions assigned","__record":{"title":{"ar":"Western South Pacific High Aragonite Saturation State Zone","en":"Western South Pacific High Aragonite Saturation State Zone","es":"Western South Pacific High Aragonite Saturation State Zone","fr":"Western South Pacific High Aragonite Saturation State Zone","ru":"Western South Pacific High Aragonite Saturation State Zone","zh":"Western South Pacific High Aragonite Saturation State Zone"},"description":{"ar":"Climate change is predicted to have negative impacts on marine ecosystems in the Pacific over the next 100 years.

It also encompasses four marine Important Bird Areas (IBAs) that identify foraging areas based upon seaward extensions around nesting colonies."},"region":"other","url":"http://chm.cbd.int/database/record?documentID=200055"},"style":{"strokeColor":"#FFFFFF","fillColor":"#FFFFFF"}},"geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-179.880546,-17.240273],[-180,-17.256749],[-180,-16.269716],[-179.81204,-16.130486],[-179.716133,-15.938671],[-179.579122,-15.623547],[-179.250297,-15.623547],[-178.976275,-15.979775],[-179.017378,-16.404508],[-179.332503,-16.95255],[-179.880546,-17.240273]]],[[[180,-17.256749],[179.722123,-17.295077],[179.461803,-16.938849],[179.612515,-16.69223],[179.818031,-16.404508],[180,-16.269716],[180,-17.256749]]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"dissolve":"South Pacific|TRUE","NAMEFINAL":"EBSA No. 21: Northern New Zealand/South Fiji Basin","EBSAFINAL":21,"INSIDEBND":"TRUE","EBSAREGION":"South Pacific","area_laea":35904257599.8,"area_mea":36322254315.8,"area_cea":3,"merge":"","Workshop":"No regions assigned","__record":{"title":{"ar":"Northern New Zealand/South Fiji Basin","en":"Northern New Zealand/South Fiji Basin","es":"Northern New Zealand/South Fiji Basin","fr":"Northern New Zealand/South Fiji Basin","ru":"Northern New Zealand/South Fiji Basin","zh":"Northern New Zealand/South Fiji Basin"},"description":{"ar":"This area north of New Zealand and west of the Kermadec Islands has primarily been identified as the core foraging area for the Parkinson’s petrel (Procellaria parkinosoni) during the breeding season (Oct-June), a species listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.

The continental shelf-edge zone is a marine ecotone where different components of the demersal, benthic and benthopelagic communities of the continental shelf, upper slope and adjacent pelagic biota coexist in a narrow strip along the continental margin.

Sin embargo, pocos de estos volcanes llegan a la superficie del Mar Caribe.\nLa temperatura de la superficie del mar a lo largo de la plataforma continental de Nicaragua es generalmente constante en diferentes lugares y varía temporalmente sólo de 2 a 3º C.\nDebajo de la superficie, la estructura del agua está altamente estratificada en los 1.200 m. superiores; débilmente estratificados entre los 1.200 y 2.000 m. y uniforme debajo de los 2.000 m. Esta estratificación está directamente relacionada a la poca profundidad de los pasajes entre las Antillas Menores, que funcionan como umbrales e impiden el flujo de aguas profundas al Caribe (Gordon 1967; Gyory et al., 2005a).\nDurante un estudio de campo de las características oceanográficas de la plataforma de Nicaragua, realizado en 1976, Robert & Murray (1983) midieron perfiles de temperatura y salinidad a través de la plataforma desde Punta Perlas hacia el este hasta el margen de la plataforma,  La distribución de temperaturas a través de la plataforma muestra una estratificación significativa. \n\nEl Caribe, incluida la plataforma continental de Nicaragua y las aguas de pendiente, están dominadas por los vientos alisios hacia el noreste. Los vientos típicos soplan del este al noroeste a velocidades que van de 6-9 m./s, persistentemente más fuertes de diciembre a marzo y menos persistentes y fuertes en abril a marzo y octubre a noviembre (Figura 5-19; Murray et al. 1982). Sin embargo, los vientos más fuertes en la zona suroeste del Caribe ocurren durante el paso de los huracanes desde Agosto a Octubre. Los huracanes se propagan regularmente del este al oeste a lo largo de la plataforma continental y tocan tierra a lo largo de la costa caribeña de Nicaragua (Figura 5-20).\nDurante los huracanes los vientos pueden llegar a velocidades de más de 70m/s, en el caso del Huracán Félix, tocó tierra ligeramente al sur de la frontera entre Honduras y Nicaragua con  una categoría máxima de 5 en la escala de huracanes de Saffir-Simpson con vientos sostenidos de 72 m/s. La  frecuencia de tormentas tropicales/huracanes es de menos de 20 por siglo para la zona entre Corn Island y Little Corn Island y la frontera entre Nicaragua y Honduras (Gentry 1971).\nHay información general sobre la biología de aproximadamente 300 especies de peces que viven en el medio ambiente poco profundo del Caribe de Nicaragua (INPESCA 2004, Ryan 2003); La información sobre peces de aguas profundas fue Recopilada recientemente (Pasenic-INPESCA 2008) a lo largo de la pendiente de la plataforma continental especies de pargo (lutjanidae) especies de mero Contribuyeron al segundo grupo  más grande de peces de aguas profundas capturados. Todas las especies se encuentran a través del Caribe todas las especies están relacionadas con un sustrato de aguas profundas específico (hábitat) y cada especie aparentemente   tiene una relación estrecha con su hábitat, en lugar de peces que nadan constantemente, como los pelágicos.\nEspecies características de la zona:\n\nPrincipales Especies:\n\t\t\tLongitud Total (cm)\nNo.\t1.

Its configuration and size are the outcomes of two independent spreading processes: one that formed the North Atlantic in the early Mesozoic nearly 200 million years ago, and another that originated the South Atlantic, 100 million years later (Fairhead & Wilson, 2004). As a consequence, northern and southern sectors of the Atlantic not only diverged in age but also in their spreading direction, connectivity with other oceans and oceanographic patterns. Yet they remained connected near the Equator by a relatively narrow area defined as the Equatorial Atlantic and characterized by (a) multiple 1000 – 6000 m deep benthic habitats formed by the Mid-Atlantic ridge and the Equatorial Fracture Zone, (b) the interference of circulation patterns of deep water masses of the Atlantic and (c) the influence of surface oceanographic processes, including a seasonal phytoplankton bloom that affect both pelagic and benthic ecosystems. These features combined differentiate the equatorial zone from the adjacent north and south oceanic basins, and particularly from their oligotrophic tropical and subtropical pelagic systems. In that sense the Equatorial Atlantic is unique in the Atlantic Ocean, as also supported by both empirically shown and modeled patterns of biodiversity. It is worth noting that the area also includes a Mid-Atlantic ridge-associated group of islets, the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, whose coastal fauna and flora has been connected with oceanic dispersal processes among the Atlantic’s continental margins and oceanic islands (see reviews in Vianna et al., 2009 and Vaske Jr. 2010) and a recently mapped hydrothermal vent field (Devey et al., 2005).\nComprehensive descriptions of seafloor features and major oceanographic and productivity patterns are available in the literature and derive from large-scale oceanographic programmes and satellite imagery analysis (e.g., Ocean Drilling Program, InterRidge, IOC – GOOS, UK Atlantic Meridional Transect - AMT and others).  Some of these programmes also include general data on diversity, distribution and abundance of zooplankton, pelagic fish and cephalopods that cover the Equatorial as well as adjacent tropical and subtropical areas of the North and South Atlantic (e.g. Gibbons, 1997; Rosa et al., 2008; Kobilianski et al., 2011). Particular data sets also derive from a long-standing research programme on the coastal areas and pelagic system in the vicinity of the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago (ProArquipelago - Vianna et al., 2009 and Vaske Jr. 2010) and from pelagic fishing for large predators (tunas, billfishes, sharks) concentrated at the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT, www.iccat.org). Other data sets on seabird and sea turtle distribution and migrations complement our understanding of the biological relevance of the Equatorial Atlantic for nekton communities (e.g. Witt et al., 2011). Finally, data on bathy- and benthopelagic as well as benthic fauna are less comprehensive. Yet recent large-scale surveys derived from the Census of Marine Life programme (e.g., MAR-ECO – http://www.mar-eco.no; ChEss –http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/chess/) have produced novel and relevant information on the biota associated with Equatorial Atlantic deep habitats.\nThe Equatorial Atlantic combines a wide spectra of historical, geological, oceanographic and biodiversity features, both in the pelagic and benthic domains, that that lead to this area being described as an EBSA in the Atlantic Ocean. This area extends mostly beyond the jurisdiction of Atlantic coastal countries, and the recognition of its importance seems crucial for eventual conservation initiatives in the high seas.","en":"The Atlantic Ocean originated from the break-up of the supercontinent Pangea in the Mesozoic and has been regarded as the youngest of the major world oceans (Levin and Gooday, 2003).

Some of these programmes also include general data on diversity, distribution and abundance of zooplankton, pelagic fish and cephalopods that cover the Equatorial as well as adjacent tropical and subtropical areas of the North and South Atlantic (e.g. Gibbons, 1997; Rosa et al., 2008; Kobilianski et al., 2011). Particular data sets also derive from a long-standing research programme on the coastal areas and pelagic system in the vicinity of the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago (ProArquipelago - Vianna et al., 2009 and Vaske Jr. 2010) and from pelagic fishing for large predators (tunas, billfishes, sharks) concentrated at the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT, www.iccat.org). Other data sets on seabird and sea turtle distribution and migrations complement our understanding of the biological relevance of the Equatorial Atlantic for nekton communities (e.g. Witt et al., 2011). Finally, data on bathy- and benthopelagic as well as benthic fauna are less comprehensive. Yet recent large-scale surveys derived from the Census of Marine Life programme (e.g., MAR-ECO – http://www.mar-eco.no; ChEss –http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/chess/) have produced novel and relevant information on the biota associated with Equatorial Atlantic deep habitats.\nThe Equatorial Atlantic combines a wide spectra of historical, geological, oceanographic and biodiversity features, both in the pelagic and benthic domains, that that lead to this area being described as an EBSA in the Atlantic Ocean. This area extends mostly beyond the jurisdiction of Atlantic coastal countries, and the recognition of its importance seems crucial for eventual conservation initiatives in the high seas.","es":"The Atlantic Ocean originated from the break-up of the supercontinent Pangea in the Mesozoic and has been regarded as the youngest of the major world oceans (Levin and Gooday, 2003). Its configuration and size are the outcomes of two independent spreading processes: one that formed the North Atlantic in the early Mesozoic nearly 200 million years ago, and another that originated the South Atlantic, 100 million years later (Fairhead & Wilson, 2004). As a consequence, northern and southern sectors of the Atlantic not only diverged in age but also in their spreading direction, connectivity with other oceans and oceanographic patterns. Yet they remained connected near the Equator by a relatively narrow area defined as the Equatorial Atlantic and characterized by (a) multiple 1000 – 6000 m deep benthic habitats formed by the Mid-Atlantic ridge and the Equatorial Fracture Zone, (b) the interference of circulation patterns of deep water masses of the Atlantic and (c) the influence of surface oceanographic processes, including a seasonal phytoplankton bloom that affect both pelagic and benthic ecosystems.

It comprises the Abrolhos and Royal Charlotte banks, an area of 56.000 km2. It harbours the highest marine biodiversity in the South Atlantic, the largest coral reefs in Brazil, and relatively large populations of several endemic and endangered marine species. It presents a mosaic of different habitats, like mangroves, seagrasses meadows, rhodolith beds, submerged and emergent reefs, and a group of small volcanic islands. Abrolhos also has unique biological formations, such as the large mushroom-shaped reef formations – “chapeirões”, and unique geological formations, such as the “buracas” – distinctive depressions in the shelf plain (up to 20 metres deep and 70 metres wide). The region is an important breeding and/or fishing site for several flagship species, such as humpback whales, sea turtles and seabirds. Despite the biological relevance and uniqueness of this region, only 7% of it is within effective protected areas. Several factors put this great diversity in danger, such as large projects related to oil and cellulose.\nThe Vitória Trindade Chain, located on the central coast of Brazil, is composed of seven seamounts and an island complex (Archipelago of Trinidad and Martin Vaz). The substrate of the mountains and ocean islands is composed of living reefs of coralline algae, on which is also observed the presence of different species of corals, sponges and algae. The mountains and islands have a fauna of reef fish that is still preserved, with a significant biomass and abundance of species, harbouring many sharks and spawning aggregation phenomena of important fishery resources. Moreover, the fish fauna of the Vitória e Trindade Chain has at least 11 endemic species on their reefs. Also, this area is the only breeding site for three endemic populations of seabirds, the Trindade Petrel (Pterodroma arminjoniana), the Atlantic Lesser Frigatebird (Fregata minor nicolli), and the Atlantic Greater Frigatebird (Fregata ariel trinitiatis). In the meantime, this environment can be considered high in uniqueness, importance for the life cycle of many species, important for endangered species, highly sensitive, high in biological productivity, and relatively well kept. Despite all this wealth and uniqueness, the increase in fishing effort, which has already caused extinctions of species in several other Brazilian islands and now focuses on this area, threatens sharks and other large carnivores. The threat scenario raises the need for protection of the natural environment and is recognized by the Brazilian government as an extremely important priority area for biodiversity conservation.","en":"The Abrolhos Region is an enlargement of the Brazilian continental shelf located on the eastern shore of Brazil, in the southern part of Bahia and northern part of Espírito Santo states.

The threat scenario raises the need for protection of the natural environment and is recognized by the Brazilian government as an extremely important priority area for biodiversity conservation."},"region":"other","url":"http://chm.cbd.int/database/record?documentID=200106"},"style":{"strokeColor":"#FFFFFF","fillColor":"#FFFFFF"}},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-37.07379,-18.975548],[-36.269436,-19.883561],[-34.013001,-20.312539],[-30.938236,-19.908067],[-29.788612,-20.016549],[-28.770614,-20.14694],[-28.492885,-20.474862],[-28.674156,-20.918603],[-29.573522,-21.075374],[-33.519735,-21.608086],[-36.150333,-21.290052],[-36.472935,-22.177209],[-36.979882,-22.499811],[-37.478233,-22.794966],[-38.301844,-22.241332],[-39.503095,-21.439831],[-40.620682,-20.840712],[-39.84874,-19.653996],[-39.675918,-18.801404],[-39.652875,-18.282935],[-39.2381,-17.729902],[-39.169297,-16.991804],[-38.772547,-15.625257],[-37.897178,-15.630288],[-37.452264,-16.070804],[-36.910753,-16.220583],[-36.513692,-16.304423],[-36.109191,-16.528195],[-35.741061,-16.61929],[-35.618199,-16.832663],[-35.65356,-17.181719],[-35.263176,-17.672295],[-35.355348,-18.064026],[-35.745011,-18.301692],[-36.927806,-18.781624],[-37.07379,-18.975548]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"OBJECTID":9,"NAME":"Southern Brazilian Sea","SUBMITTED_":"Brazil","Area_MW_KM":597247,"Workshop":"No regions assigned","__record":{"title":{"ar":"Seaflower","en":"Seaflower","es":"Seaflower","fr":"Seaflower","ru":"Seaflower","zh":"Seaflower"},"description":{"ar":"The Seaflower is located in the Southwestern Caribbean eco-region, in the most northerly part of Colombia.

The area contains one of the largest and most productive open-ocean coral reefs in the Caribbean; provides rare, unique and unusual reef environments; contains remote areas demonstrating high integrity and little anthropogenic influence; and displays a continuum of habitats that support significant levels of marine biodiversity. With the presence of 192 Red List species, it is an important site for the conservation of endangered and threatened species of global concern. The Seaflower was recognized by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve, and preselected as a potential World Heritage Site by Colombia, which is zoning it  as a multiple-use area with five zoning types.
