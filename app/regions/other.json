Tropical reef-building corals secrete calcium carbonate as aragonite and tend to show a reduction in calcification rate at lower seawater aragonite saturation states (Langdon and Atkinson 2005). Aragonite is the principal crystalline form of calcium carbonate deposited in coral skeletons (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007).  Values of aragonite saturation states above 4 are considered optimal, between 3.5 and 4 are considered marginal, 3-3.5 very marginal, and no corals historically are found below values of 3 (Guinotte et al. 2003). In the Pacific the value of aragonite saturation state in surface waters on average has dropped from around 4.5  to a current value of 3.7 over the last 200 years.\nCurrent measurements show an area to the east of American Samoa has the highest aragonite concentrations at present. As ocean acidification is driven primarily by the uptake of atmospheric CO2 the rates of decrease in aragonite saturation state are similar for the entire region. Consequently those areas with currently higher aragonite saturation states are the least affected for the longest period under climate change projections. Therefore, this area has special biological and ecological value as an area where the impact from ocean acidification will be slowest and from which recovery may potentially be the quickest.","en":"Climate change is predicted to have negative impacts on marine ecosystems in the Pacific over the next 100 years.

As ocean acidification is driven primarily by the uptake of atmospheric CO2 the rates of decrease in aragonite saturation state are similar for the entire region.

Studies have shown that as the ocean takes up atmospheric CO2, thereby mitigating the rate of climate change, there is a concomitant increase in ocean acidification. This in turn means a reduction in carbonate ion concentration and hence a reduced ability of reef-building organisms to calcify.  Tropical reef-building corals secrete calcium carbonate as aragonite and tend to show a reduction in calcification rate at lower seawater aragonite saturation states (Langdon and Atkinson 2005). Aragonite is the principal crystalline form of calcium carbonate deposited in coral skeletons (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007).  Values of aragonite saturation states above 4 are considered optimal, between 3.5 and 4 are considered marginal, 3-3.5 very marginal, and no corals historically are found below values of 3 (Guinotte et al. 2003). In the Pacific the value of aragonite saturation state in surface waters on average has dropped from around 4.5  to a current value of 3.7 over the last 200 years.\nCurrent measurements show an area to the east of American Samoa has the highest aragonite concentrations at present. As ocean acidification is driven primarily by the uptake of atmospheric CO2 the rates of decrease in aragonite saturation state are similar for the entire region. Consequently those areas with currently higher aragonite saturation states are the least affected for the longest period under climate change projections.

Chains are inserted in an oligotrophic environment and Fernando de Noronha and Rocas Atoll are seen as a “hotspot\" due to the presence of coral reef formations, high biodiversity and endemism. The area is a spawning site and / or feeding site for turtles, elasmobranchs, reef fish and pelagic fish. The area is a feeding site for breeding seabirds at Fernando de Noronha and covers part of the most important seabird migration corridor in the Atlantic; both sites qualify as BirdLife Important Bird Areas (IBAs) for both threatened species and congregations. Some birds, elasmobranchs and turtles species, which are listed on the IUCN red list as threatened, occur in the area. Sharks, reef fishes and lobsters are targets for fisheries carried out in the region. Fishing exploitation is a traditional activity in the area. Sea turtles are also subject to incidental catch by pelagic longline and ghost nets. The Rocas Atoll has the highest rate of endemism in the region, and Fernando de Noronha has the highest species richness when compared to other Brazilian oceanic islands. Fernando de Noronha and Rocas Atoll fauna display great similarity, which is attributed to the presence of shallow oceanic banks that function as steps tones in the area.

up to the Ceará states, where the Brazilian continental shelf is narrow and breaks abruptly at depths between 50 and 80m. The shelf width varies along the coast, reaching minimums of 8 km (off Bahia state), to over 80 km (north Ceará). The continental shelf-edge zone is a marine ecotone where different components of the demersal, benthic and benthopelagic communities of the continental shelf, upper slope and adjacent pelagic biota coexist in a narrow strip along the continental margin. This ecotone, characterized by high population densities and species richness, provides a concentration of diverse fishing resources over a relatively narrow area, easily accessible to local artisanal fleets and sustaining important traditional multispecific reef fisheries. Biogenic reef formations associated with outer shelf channels, ravines and deeper canyons represent important traditional fishing grounds. The north-eastern Brazilian shelf-edge zone contains distinct habitats and unusual geomorphological features such as shelf-edge reefs that represent a last refuge for some rare or endemic reef fishes distributed across the continental margin, including threatened (IUCN) commercial species of the snapper-grouper complex, currently depleted within the Brazilian EEZ. The shelf-edge harbours critical habitats for the life cycle of many sea turtles, whales, sharks and reef fish species, including migratory corridors and fish spawning aggregation sites that are extremely vulnerable to human pressures, such as intensive commercial and recreational fishing, shipping and offshore oil and gas exploitation, all activities currently expanding off the Brazilian coast. The area covers part of the most important seabird migration corridor in the Atlantic, a site which qualifies as a Birdlife Important Bird Area (IBA) for both threatened species and congregations. This region corresponds to a portion of the breeding ground of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) off the north-eastern coast of Brazil. It also corresponds to an important habitat of various relatively low-density cetacean populations, including Bryde’s whales (Balaenoptera cf. edeni), dwarf minke whales (B. acutorostrata), and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus).  The Assessment of the Sustainable Yield of the Living Resources in the Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone Program    (REVIZEE Program ) has extensively sampled this area meeting EBSA criteria. Results indicated great bottom heterogeneity of the shelf and slope, with the occurrence of important canyons, which provide structural complexity and varied micro-habitats, allowing a greater number of benthic species in the area.

The area covers part of the most important seabird migration corridor in the Atlantic, a site which qualifies as a Birdlife Important Bird Area (IBA) for both threatened species and congregations. This region corresponds to a portion of the breeding ground of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) off the north-eastern coast of Brazil. It also corresponds to an important habitat of various relatively low-density cetacean populations, including Bryde’s whales (Balaenoptera cf. edeni), dwarf minke whales (B. acutorostrata), and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus).  The Assessment of the Sustainable Yield of the Living Resources in the Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone Program    (REVIZEE Program ) has extensively sampled this area meeting EBSA criteria. Results indicated great bottom heterogeneity of the shelf and slope, with the occurrence of important canyons, which provide structural complexity and varied micro-habitats, allowing a greater number of benthic species in the area. Recent studies reinforce the hypotheses of a faunal corridor for reef fish species associated with deep reef formations along the shelf-edge zone in the South American continental margin, connecting

the supercontinent Pangea in the Mesozoic and has been regarded as the youngest of the major world oceans (Levin and Gooday, 2003). Its configuration and size are the outcomes of two independent spreading processes: one that formed the North Atlantic in the early Mesozoic nearly 200 million years ago, and another that originated the South Atlantic, 100 million years later (Fairhead & Wilson, 2004). As a consequence, northern and southern sectors of the Atlantic not only diverged in age but also in their spreading direction, connectivity with other oceans and oceanographic patterns. Yet they remained connected near the Equator by a relatively narrow area defined as the Equatorial Atlantic and characterized by (a) multiple 1000 – 6000 m deep benthic habitats formed by the Mid-Atlantic ridge and the Equatorial Fracture Zone, (b) the interference of circulation patterns of deep water masses of the Atlantic and (c) the influence of surface oceanographic processes, including a seasonal phytoplankton bloom that affect both pelagic and benthic ecosystems. These features combined differentiate the equatorial zone from the adjacent north and south oceanic basins, and particularly from their oligotrophic tropical and subtropical pelagic systems. In that sense the Equatorial Atlantic is unique in the Atlantic Ocean, as also supported by both empirically shown and modeled patterns of biodiversity. It is worth noting that the area also includes a Mid-Atlantic ridge-associated group of islets, the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, whose coastal fauna and flora has been connected with oceanic dispersal processes among the Atlantic’s continental margins and oceanic islands (see reviews in Vianna et al., 2009 and Vaske Jr. 2010) and a recently mapped hydrothermal vent field (Devey et al., 2005).\nComprehensive descriptions of seafloor features and major oceanographic and productivity patterns are available in the literature and derive from large-scale oceanographic programmes and satellite imagery analysis (e.g., Ocean Drilling Program, InterRidge, IOC – GOOS, UK Atlantic Meridional Transect - AMT and others).  Some of these programmes also include general data on diversity, distribution and abundance of zooplankton, pelagic fish and cephalopods that cover the Equatorial as well as adjacent tropical and subtropical areas of the North and South Atlantic (e.g. Gibbons, 1997; Rosa et al., 2008; Kobilianski et al., 2011). Particular data sets also derive from a long-standing research programme on the coastal areas and pelagic system in the vicinity of the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago (ProArquipelago - Vianna et al., 2009 and Vaske Jr. 2010) and from pelagic fishing for large predators (tunas, billfishes, sharks) concentrated at the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT, www.iccat.org). Other data sets on seabird and sea turtle distribution and migrations complement our understanding of the biological relevance of the Equatorial Atlantic for nekton communities (e.g. Witt et al., 2011). Finally, data on bathy- and benthopelagic as well as benthic fauna are less comprehensive. Yet recent large-scale surveys derived from the Census of Marine Life programme (e.g., MAR-ECO – http://www.mar-eco.no; ChEss –http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/chess/) have produced novel and relevant information on the biota associated with Equatorial Atlantic deep habitats.\nThe Equatorial Atlantic combines a wide spectra of historical, geological, oceanographic and biodiversity features, both in the pelagic and benthic domains, that that lead to this area being described as an EBSA in the Atlantic Ocean. This area extends mostly beyond the jurisdiction of Atlantic coastal countries, and the recognition of its importance seems crucial for eventual conservation initiatives in the high seas.","en":"The Atlantic Ocean originated from the break-up of the supercontinent Pangea in the Mesozoic and has been regarded as the youngest of the major world oceans (Levin and Gooday, 2003).

It is worth noting that the area also includes a Mid-Atlantic ridge-associated group of islets, the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, whose coastal fauna and flora has been connected with oceanic dispersal processes among the Atlantic’s continental margins and oceanic islands (see reviews in Vianna et al., 2009 and Vaske Jr. 2010) and a recently mapped hydrothermal vent field (Devey et al., 2005).\nComprehensive descriptions of seafloor features and major oceanographic and productivity patterns are available in the literature and derive from large-scale oceanographic programmes and satellite imagery analysis (e.g., Ocean Drilling Program, InterRidge, IOC – GOOS, UK Atlantic Meridional Transect - AMT and others).  Some of these programmes also include general data on diversity, distribution and abundance of zooplankton, pelagic fish and cephalopods that cover the Equatorial as well as adjacent tropical and subtropical areas of the North and South Atlantic (e.g. Gibbons, 1997; Rosa et al., 2008; Kobilianski et al., 2011). Particular data sets also derive from a long-standing research programme on the coastal areas and pelagic system in the vicinity of the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago (ProArquipelago - Vianna et al., 2009 and Vaske Jr. 2010) and from pelagic fishing for large predators (tunas, billfishes, sharks) concentrated at the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT, www.iccat.org). Other data sets on seabird and sea turtle distribution and migrations complement our understanding of the biological relevance of the Equatorial Atlantic for nekton communities (e.g. Witt et al., 2011).

Due to its high biological productivity, industrial fishing effort has been concentrated here, which had resulted in an overexploitation of several fisheries stocks, some of which collapsed, as well as high bycatch, including several endangered species of cetaceans, seabirds, fishes and marine turtles."},"region":{"identifier":"other","title":{"en":""}},"url":"http://chm.cbd.int/database/record?documentID=200107"},"style":{"strokeColor":"#FFFFFF","fillColor":"#FFFFFF"}},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-44.861348,-28.236892],[-44.877088,-28.264063],[-42.924649,-28.412618],[-41.485985,-28.552976],[-40.994734,-28.552976],[-40.047321,-28.447708],[-39.170086,-28.517887],[-38.784103,-28.517887],[-39.029729,-28.728423],[-39.415712,-28.90387],[-39.626248,-29.219674],[-39.591159,-29.746015],[-39.626248,-30.412713],[-39.942052,-30.482891],[-40.089428,-30.630267],[-40.117499,-30.658338],[-40.08241,-30.939053],[-39.856176,-31.06833],[-39.731516,-31.289947],[-40.08241,-31.781198],[-40.433304,-31.921555],[-41.064912,-31.851377],[-42.117593,-32.482985],[-42.468487,-32.342628],[-43.450989,-32.447896],[-44.573849,-32.20227],[-45.556352,-32.20227],[-46.082692,-32.833879],[-45.591441,-33.254951],[-45.907245,-33.500577],[-47.591535,-33.746203],[-49.275825,-34.833973],[-50.118498,-35.606818],[-50.786401,-35.201696],[-51.301014,-34.884169],[-52.100308,-34.4462],[-53.3337,-33.743676],[-52.686932,-33.222669],[-52.237789,-32.198621],[-51.55509,-31.749477],[-50.926288,-31.282367],[-50.36935,-30.581703],[-50.063932,-29.845107],[-49.578856,-29.126477],[-49.039884,-28.659367],[-48.824295,-28.569538],[-47.816645,-28.181981],[-47.781953,-28.118094],[-47.781082,-28.11649],[-44.861348,-28.236892]]]}}]}
