The park covers an area of 552.18 km2, of which 80.5 km2 are terrestrial. The main reason for gazetting the area as a marine protected area is the high number of coelacanth catches in the area during the previous eight years. Scientific research and the use of remotely operated videos in the area have shown coelacanths living in caves at depths between 150 and 200 metres.\n \nCoelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) is a fossil fish which was believed to have been extinct for the past 60 million years. The first recorded catch in Tanzania of coelacanth, one of the world’s rarest and most enigmatic deep-water fishes, occurred in September 2003 at Kilwa. This stimulated considerable interest and was announced two days later at the World Parks Congress by Dr Sylvia Earle. Since then more than 52 captures of coelacanths have been reported by fishers in the fishing villages of Kigombe, Mwarongo and Mwambani, in Tanga Region, Mtwara, Lindi and Dar es Salaam using deep-set shark nets (locally called Jarife). By September 2005, 25 coelacanths had been caught in Tanzania, 19 in a six-month period. This is the greatest number of coelacanths caught in the shortest time anywhere in the world. The vast majority of fish were caught off the Tanga-Kigombe coast.","en":"Tanga Coelacanth Marine Park was formally established on 28 August 2009 through publication of Government Notice No: 307 of 2009.

The scarce knowledge on these species is based on data collected during aerial surveys conducted between 1994 and 2001, and information from stranded animals. Since then, some of these species have been in constant decline in the Western Indian Ocean, facing real threats such as by-catch in fishing gears, loss of habitat, over-fishing or whale/dolphin-watching activities. To address this the Kenyan Marine Mammal Network was established in 2011 and is a partnership between Global Vision International, Watamu Marine Association, Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenya Association of Sea Anglers and Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute to provide the first consistent data on occurrence and abundance of marine mammals along the Kenyan coast."},"region":{"identifier":"800F52F9-E7A7-47F2-94E4-EA34F60A13A1","title":{"en":"Southern Indian Ocean"}},"url":"http://chm.cbd.int/database/record?documentID=204002"},"style":{"strokeColor":"#FFFFFF","fillColor":"#FFFFFF"}},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[39.96580341429632,-3.397413663409679],[39.9634628684168,-3.36358978264218],[39.97074961360397,-3.358045519784754],[39.97205353794055,-3.390844887481421],[39.97499087123191,-3.389906554643631],[40.10958103713534,-3.299639887670537],[40.11540603775859,-3.294639887320784],[40.12666451015917,-3.244150939514099],[40.19946848608197,-3.317690308161048],[40.02411463738082,-3.47398395599464],[39.96580341429632,-3.397413663409679]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"NAME":"Iles Eparses (part of the Mozambique Channel)","Workshop":"Southern Indian Ocean","EBSA_ID":20,"GLOBAL_ID":"SIO_20","__record":{"title":{"ar":"The Iles Éparses (part of the Mozambique Channel)","en":"The Iles Éparses (part of the Mozambique Channel)","es":"The Iles Éparses (part of the Mozambique Channel)","fr":"The Iles Éparses (part of the Mozambique Channel)","ru":"The Iles Éparses (part of the Mozambique Channel)","zh":"The Iles Éparses (part of the Mozambique Channel)"},"description":{"ar":"Four of the five “Scattered islands” (literal translation of “Iles Éparses”) stretch down the length of the Mozambique Channel, between the east coast of Africa and Madagascar: Europa, Bassas da India, Juan de Nova and Glorieuses.
